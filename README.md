# Basic-Image-Classification
Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow


In this project, we will create and train a model that takes an image of a hand written digit as input and predicts the class of that digit, that is, it predicts the digit or it predicts the class of the input image. Through this project, will learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and use it to solve a basic image classification problem.

__Data Source:__ MNIST data

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
